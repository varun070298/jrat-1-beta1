        <h>1. Let JRat Watch Your Program Run</h>

        <p>
            If you're program runs in Java 5 or above, then this step is extremely easy.
            You simply need to add a single argument to the java command that launches
            your program.
        </p>

        <terminal>java <b>-javaagent:shiftone-jrat.jar</b> [your java ops] [main class]</terminal>

        <p>
            You now want to excersize your program's functionality as much as possible so
            JRat can watch what happens and collect statistics.

            The more times you run your code, the better the results will be.

            It's ideal to have a autommated repeatable test script, but there is no
            need to get fancy the first time you run JRat.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shut down your program.

            JRat will produce several files containing the data it collected.
        </p>

        <h>2. View The JRat Results</h>

        <p>
            After you shut down your application, JRat will create data files that
            contain information about your program's execution.

            JRat puts these files in a subdirectory under the directory from which your program ran.

            This directory will be named something like <path>jrat.output/2007-08-30_AM-08-02-44</path>.
        </p>

        <p>
            These data files are not human readable.

            They require the JRat Desktop to open and analyze them.

            The JRat Desktop is contained in the same jar file that was used in the first step.
        </p>

        <terminal>java -Xmx256M -jar shiftone-jrat.jar</terminal>

        <p>
            The JRat Desktop application will open, and you can use it to view the collected data.

            To do this, select <b>File</b> then <b>Open</b> from the menu.

            Navigate to the subdirectory of <path>jrat.output</path> and open a <path>.jrat</path> file.
        </p>
