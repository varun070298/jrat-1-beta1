Release Notes:

V 1.22 (11/04/02): Reverted the code back to a jre1.1 compatible version
-jre11             Lutz Dornbusch of www.clicktivities.net performed the
                   reversion when customizing the applet for
                   www.planet-wissen.de

                   Enhaced locality stwitching at radius 1.  Now at radius 1
                   fresh nodes get added before those marked for removal get
                   taken away.  This allows more connections to be seen during
                   the transition.

                   Modified layout to improve fade out of freshly added nodes  
                   and nodes that are about to be removed.

                   Improved node scrolling to center.

                   Reactivated hyperbolic lens.

V 1.21 (04/04/02): Fixed copyright date from 2002 to 2001-2002

                   Added a collapseNode method, which has the opposite effect of 
	           expandNode.  Fixed the hide node method so that hiding is  
                   independent of selection.

                   Simplified getting and setting the zoom, rotation, and
                   horizontal + vertical scrollbar values so that these can be  
                   saved/retrieved more easily.

                   Added new parameters to the set locality method to support 
                   the extension of the GraphLayout code by the TGWikiBrowser. 
                   Now one can prevent nodes with high edge degrees from being 
                   shown or expanded, or chose to follow only outgoing edges.

V 1.20 (01/02/02): Changed License to TouchGraph LLC. Apache-Style Software 
                   License.  
                   
                   Began code cleanup + addition of javadoc hooks to comply with 
                   Sun's coding standards.  
                   
                   Changes to suport the extension of the GraphLayout code by 
                   the TGLinkBrowser:
                   Nodes are now given unique node id's. 
                   Nodes can be rectangular, rounded-rectangles, or eliptical.  

V 1.07 (10/28/01): Switched to Swing.  Added locality navigation tools.  
                   Implemented edge Selection.  Began toolbar improvements.

V 1.06 (9/30/01):  Implemented locality.  

V 1.05 (9/09/01):  Made interfaces (such as moving nodes by dragging) plugable. 

V 1.04 (8/19/01):  Fixed Horiz + Vert Scrollbars.  

V 1.03 (8/04/01):  Made design more modular.  Implemented a hyperbolic lens.

V 1.02 (7/22/01):  Added comments
