        <p>
            JRat works by weaving it's own instructions into your program. It doesn't modify
            your source code, it modifies the compiled bytecode that gets compiled into your
            class files and jars. JRat basicly adds logic that when executed, tells JRat what's
            going on.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a concept used by many AOP frameworks. JRat doesn't use any standard AOP
            libraries, but it does add a custom before and end advice to every monitored method.

            <code><![CDATA[
public class MyClass {
    private static final MethodHandler handler = HandlerFactory.getHandler(...);

    public Object doSomething() {

        handler.onMethodStart(this);
        long startTime = Clock.getTime();

        try {

           Object result = real_renamed_doSomething(); // call your method

           handler.onMethodFinish(this, Clock.getTime() - startTime, null);

        } catch(Throwable e) {

           handler.onMethodFinish(this, Clock.getTime() - startTime, e);
           throw e;

        }
    }

    public Object real_renamed_doSomething() {
        // do something
    }

            <h>The Java Agent (Loadtime Weaving)</h>
            <p>
                Java 5 supports the Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface (JVMTI).

                This JVM feature allows a command line argument to be used to specify a
                <i>Java Agent</i>
                .

                The
                <i>Java Agent</i>
                is a special Java class that gets called before
                anything else happens (even before the application's main method gets
                called).

                The agent is given the opportunity to install a filter that will receieve
                callbacks to transform classes as they are loaded.

                This approach is nice because...
                <ul>
                    <li>It's easy. You can install JRat it just by adding a comand line argmument.</li>
                    <li>It's lazy. Only the loaded classes need to be trasformed.</li>
                    <li>It's dynamic. Every time you run your application, the agent examines your
                        <b>jrat.xml</b>
                        configuration to decide what to inject. If you remove the command
                        line argument, then JRat is uninstalled.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
