    <p>
        If you're still using Java 1.4 or earlier versions of java, the
        <b>javaagent</b>
        option
        is not avalible to you, and you will need to inject your bytecode at "build time" (as
        oposed to "run time").
    </p>
    <p>
        This document intends to be a first time walk through for developers new to JRat.

        <h>2. Inject your Application's Classes</h>

        <p>
            Once you have built your application, you will no doubt have a directory
            full of classes, jar files, or both.

            JRat needs to modify your class files in order to monitor what your code is doing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Open the JRat Desktop with the following command.

            <terminal>java -Xmx256M -jar shiftone-jrat.jar</terminal>


            There are two menu bar options under <b>Inject</b>.
            <ul>
                <li>Inject Directory - use this option to inject all archive files (jar,ear,war,sar,har,zip)
                    and classes beneath a selected directory.</li>

                <li>Inject File - use this option to inject a single selected archive or class file.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            It is important to understand that your application now has a dependency on JRat.
            Your program will no longer run without JRat.
            To <i>uninstall</i> JRat you need to recompile your java code.
